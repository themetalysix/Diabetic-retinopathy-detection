# Diabetic-retinopathy-detection
This project develops a machine learning-based software to predict Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) using structured clinical data instead of images. By analyzing key diagnostic features, the model will provide risk assessments, helping healthcare professionals identify high-risk patients early and improve treatment decisions.
